## 3. DESCRIPTION
This assignment is modeled after a simplified version of Chapman's registrar office.
It's goal is to provide average wait and idle times for the windows and students in the office so the registrars can make predictions about capacity requirements.

It takes an input of a text file with information about the number of windows open,
the number of students arrived, at what time they arrived, and how long they need at a
window.

### How to Run:
  1. "make all"
  2. "./assignment4 inputfilepath.txt"
